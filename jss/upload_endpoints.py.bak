            In this case the classname becomes `com.jamfsoftware.jss.objects.pushnotification.PushNotificationKeystore`.

        Sequence:

            - Hit `legacy/pushNotificationCertificate.html?id=-1&o=c`, which is usually in an IFRAME.
            - Scrape hidden inputs from <form name="f" id="f"> :
