    """Object representing JSS credentials and configuration.

    This JSSPrefs object can be used as an argument for a new JSS.
    By default and with no arguments, it uses the preference domain
    "com.github.sheagcraig.python-jss.plist". However, alternate
    configurations can be supplied to the __init__ method to use
    something else.

    If no preference file is found, an interactive configuration
    function will try to help configure python-jss.

    The preference file should include the following keys:

        - **jss_url**: String, full path, including port, to JSS, e.g.
          "https://mycasper.donkey.com:8443".
        - **jss_user**: String, API username to use.
        - **jss_pass**: String, API password.
        - **verify**: *(Optional)* Boolean for whether to verify the JSS's
          certificate matches the SSL traffic. This certificate must
          be in your keychain. Defaults to True.
        - **suppress_warnings**: *(Optional)* Boolean for whether to suppress
          the urllib3 warnings likely spamming you if you choose not
          to set verify=False. Enabled by default when verify=False.
        - **repos:** *(Optional)* A list of file repositories dicts to connect.
            - repos dicts:

                CDP and JDS distribution points require:

                - **name:** String name of the distribution point. Must match
                  the value on the JSS.
                - **password:** String password for the read/write user.

                This form uses the distributionpoints API call to determine
                the remaining information. There is also an explicit form;
                See the distribution_points module for more info

                CDP, JDS and AWS types require one dict for the master, with
                key:

                - **type:** String, "CDP", "JDS" or "AWS".

                AWS distribution points require:

                - **aws_access_key_id:** The access key ID for the user with r/w permission
                    to the jamf bucket
                - **aws_secret_access_key:** The secret key for this user. NOTE: to avoid storing sensitive credentials
                    this can also be read from the environment variable `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
